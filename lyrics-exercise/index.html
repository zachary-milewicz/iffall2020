                Today is gonna be the day <br>
                That they're gonna throw it back to you <br>
                By now you should've somehow <br>
                Realized what you gotta do <br>
                I don't believe that anybody <br>
                Feels the way I do, about you now <br>  <br>

                Backbeat, the word was on the street <br>
                That the fire in your heart is out <br>
                I'm sure you've heard it all before <br>
                But you never really had a doubt <br>
                I don't believe that anybody <br>
                Feels the way I do about you now <br> <br>

                And all the roads we have to walk are winding <br>
                And all the lights that lead us there are blinding <br>
                There are many things that I <br>
                Would like to say to you but I don't know how <br> <br>

                Because maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me <br>
                And after all, you're my wonderwall <br> <br>

                Today was gonna be the day <br>
                But they'll never throw it back to you <br>
                By now you should've somehow <br>
                Realized what you're not to do <br>
                I don't believe that anybody <br>
                Feels the way I do, about you now <br>  <br>

                And all the roads that lead you there are winding <br>
                And all the lights that light the way are blinding <br>
                There are many things that I <br>
                Would like to say to you but I don't know how <br>  <br>

                I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me <br>
                And after all, you're my wonderwall <br>  <br>

                I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me <br> 
                And after all, you're my wonderwall <br>  <br>

                I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me <br>
                you're gonna be the one that saves me <br>
                you're gonna be the one that saves me <br>
